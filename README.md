# deriv

An open source derivative calculator REST API. (In progress!)

At this point, I've finished designing and implementing how expressions can be created and put together,
written most of the necessary unit tests, and described the language I expect the parser to follow. All
I have left to do is implement the recursive descent parser and put together a bare bones server.
